description: "I'm a Senior Scientist and co-director of the Bourne & Mura Computational Biosciences Lab, based in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Virginia; earlier on, I was an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at UVA (2008-2018). My scientific background, and most of my research interests, are in the areas of structural biology, molecular biophysics and computational biology, particularly as regards the evolution of RNA-associated ribonucleoprotein assemblies, protein folds, and protein-protein interactions. I've also become interested in the data sciences and its attendant approaches (e.g., deep learning and other machine learning paradigms), as applied to the aforementioned scientific domains."
