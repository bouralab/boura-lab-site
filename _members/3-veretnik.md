description: '
  Stella is a Senior Scientist at Borne &amp; Mura lab (currently on leave of absence). Trained in Genetics and Molecular Biology with a tinge of Computer Sciences, she is interested in computational approaches to molecular and structural evolution. Her former work includes development of evolutionary profiles of protein sequences, understanding the constrains underlying partitioning protein structures into domains, structural/functional evolution of Sm/lsm gene family and in-depth analysis of Small Beta Barrel fold. She is currently involved in conceptualization, definition and quantification of Urfold â€“ which groups protein (sub)structures with similar Architectures but different Topologies.
