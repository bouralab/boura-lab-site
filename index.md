# Welcome to the Bourne & Mura Computational Biosciences Lab!

We are part of the [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/) and [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/biomedical-engineering).

Our joint lab (PIs Cam Mura & Phil Bourne) works at the intersection of structural bioinformatics, data science and systems biology/pharmacology, with the objective of improving the drug discovery and safety pipeline, to improve our understanding of sequence-structure-function relationships, often from an evolutionary perspective, and broadly contribute open data and methods to further our collective understanding of living systems. Along the way, we work to improve access to knowledge through open scholarly communication.

### Interested in joining the Bourne lab?
We donâ€™t generally post for specific positions, [so please reach out!](/join) We welcome applicants from all backgrounds.
