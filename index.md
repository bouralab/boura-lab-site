# Welcome to the Bourne & Mura Computational Biosciences Lab!

We are part of the [School of Data Science](https://datascience.virginia.edu/) and [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/biomedical-engineering) at the [Univ of Virginia](https://virginia.edu/).

Our lab, co-directed by Phil Bourne and Cam Mura, works at the junctions of Structural Bioinformatics, Data Science and Systems Biology/Pharmacology, with the ultimate goals of (i) improving drug discovery and safety pipelines, (ii) deepening our understanding of biomolecular sequence/structure/function relationships, often from an evolutionary perspective, and (iii) broadly contributing open data and methods to further our collective understanding of living systems. Along the way, we work to improve access to knowledge through open scholarly communication.

### Interested in joining the Bourne lab?
We donâ€™t generally post for specific positions, [so please reach out!](/join) We welcome applicants from all backgrounds.
